## Timed Mute TV Remote

### A TV remote control using a 4x3 keypad and an Arduino Pro Mini.
### Pressing a number mutes the audio for that number of minutes.

On a normal TV remote, entering a number changes the channel to that number.
But on this one it mutes the audio for that number of minutes, then
automatically brings back the audio.  It uses a standard 4x3 keypad, and
a modified 3.3V 8MHz Arduino Pro Mini.

The IR LED should be in a fixed position so it always points to the TV.
But the keypad can be placed at a more convenient location within reach,
so you don't have to pick up the remote, you just press a key.
A "4" is usually about right for most commercial blocks.

The remote also provides for powering the TV on or off, adjusting the volume,
and changing the channel.

Everything is explained in the PDF.
